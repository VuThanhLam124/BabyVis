)

if success:
    for i, variation in enumerate(variations):
        variation.image.save(f"baby_variation_{i+1}.png")
        print(f"Variation {i+1}: {variation.description} (confidence: {variation.confidence_score:.2f})")
```

### Medical Analysis Only
```python
from medical_image_analyzer import MedicalImageAnalyzer

analyzer = MedicalImageAnalyzer()
analysis = analyzer.analyze_medical_features(ultrasound_image)

# Print detailed results
print("Detected Landmarks:")
for landmark in analysis['landmarks']:
    print(f"  {landmark.name}: {landmark.coordinates} (confidence: {landmark.confidence:.2f})")

print("Facial Measurements:")
for measurement in analysis['measurements']:
    print(f"  {measurement.measurement_type}: {measurement.value:.3f} (percentile: {measurement.percentile:.1f})")
